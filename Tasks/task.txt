javascript interview topics::
- let vs var vs const
        var: Function-scoped, can be re-declared, hoisted with an initial value of undefined.
        let: Block-scoped, no re-declaration, hoisted without initialization, allows reassignment.
        const: Block-scoped, no re-declaration or reassignment, hoisted without initialization.
- global scope vs block scope
        Global Scope: Accessible anywhere in the program, and often persistent throughout the runtime.
        Block Scope: Limited to the block where it is defined, enhancing modularity and preventing unwanted access from other parts of the program.
